    <div id="cont">
    <p style="background-color:#e6ffff">The highway is my best friend. At least once a year, my family and I like to travel from our home city of Cleveland, Ohio
      and drive to a vacation location somewhere within the US. A place that we like to visit often is named Chincoteague (pronounced "sheen-ko-teeg"), VA. This island
      is known for its local wild horses and prestine, large beaches. Hitting the Road is a great way for my family and I to unwind, relax, and reset our stress meter.

    <h2 style="color:burlywood">Hiking</h2>
    <p style="background-color:#e6ffff">In addition to traveling on the road, my family and I like to travel places by foot.
      On of our favorite things to do together is go hiking in various parks or forested areas. My sons love to find various things to pick up and examine so
      that they can learn and expand their vocabularies.</p>
