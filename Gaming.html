    <p>The most prominent type of gaming I like to engage in is the competitive type.
      There are many catagories in this type of gaming like versus, racing, and military for example.
      I'm a big fan of titles like Tekken, Call of Duty, Need for Speed, and Capcom vs. Marvel.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#00004d">"I Walk Alone"</h2>
    <p>Another big type of game with multiple catagories that I, and I'm sure many other people,
    enjoy are single player games, which may or may not be competitive. Some catagories of single players are
    adventure, shooters, and racing. Some titles that may be recognized here are games like Final Fantasy, Jak and Daxter, and God of War (screenshot above).</p>
