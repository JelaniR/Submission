      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>I am a guy in his mid twenties, with a wife and two sons. My sons are ages 2 and 5. They are the biggest, wildest, and funnest part of my life.
      I grew up in Cleveland,OH, Richmond,VA, and Boston,MA. I always wanted to work in the I.T. field, but have been off track until now. I would love to put a picture
      up of myself for all of us to see but I trust the internet as least as possible. Maybe next time?</p>
      <h2>Proffesional</h2>

      <p>I have worked many jobs in many fields. I started working when I was thirteen, doing maintenance in people homes.
        I have changed light fixtures, ceiling fans, toilets, whole house wiring, and changed entire plumbing stacks. I have worked in retail as well where I continued to
        polish my customer service skills. From there I picked up car detailing, which was lucrative but physically tiring after a while. In this field I "perfected" my
        customer service skills, being able to satisfy the most cantancerous customer. After working in this field for about a year, I picked up a few positions for Cleveland Clinic on their main campus
        and the Fairview Hospital branch. Finally, before my Cleveland Codes training, I worked for a short time in manufacturing at a steel factory. I decided to leave this position for fear of my health
        after an incident gave me a preview of the dangers in that field. Now, here I am building a website for your enjoyment. Enjoy!

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>I am a firm believer of the natural order of balance. This could most clearly be understood through the understanding of
      the concept of yin and yang, combined with the concept of karma. Therefore, I strive to impart any good will to anyone whom I may encounter.
